# Stock-market-closing-price-prediction
One of the most important task today’s generation is concerned about is predicting
the stock markets, and we all know that the stock market is highly
affected by the current affairs. In this study, we suggested a forecasting model
for predicting sentiment around stock prices of Bank-Nifty. We map feelings
to see if there’s a link between news-predicted sentiment and the original stock
price, as well as to test the efficient market theory. Finding future stock trends
is a difficult endeavour since stock trends are influenced by a variety of factors.
Presumably, news items and stock prices are connected. Furthermore, news has
the potential to change market patterns. As a result, we set out to investigate
this link in-depth and see if stock movements can be forecast using news articles
and prior price histories. We have used a pretrained FinBert model for the
sentiment analysis and a LSTM for the stock price prediction.
